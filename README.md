# Support

If you have any questions or are having any issues with the plugin, do not hesitate to make an [issue](https://github.com/c10coding/BlockBR-2.0/issues)
or join my [discord](https://discord.gg/2ZMkpkf) and go to the #support channel for help.

# Installation 
If you don't feel like reading all this junk, you can go watch my [installation video]()!
1. Download the plugin from [spigot](#) or any other reliable source
2. Put the jar file in your /plugins directory/folder
3. Restart your server, load the plugin using [PlugMan](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/plugman), or reload the server using `/reload` (Not encouraged)
4. Once the plugin has been loaded into the server, go back to your plugins folder and find the "BlockBR" folder. Once found, open it and then open the config.yml file
5. Here, you will have to get your MYSQL credentials. You can find this information in your server panel (Most servers have MYSQL databases available for you).
   * Keep in mind that Host = IP
   * **_Do NOT change the "Database" value_**
6. Once you put all your MYSQL credentials in the config file, reload the plugin or restart your server.
7. If done successfully, you should see the message "MYSQL CONNECTED!" in your console.
   * If you can't seem to get the plugin to connect your database, please refer to the support section.

# Prerequisites 
Some of these plugins are **NOT** must-have's. The **bolded** plugin names are the **required ones**

1. [**Vault**](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/vault) This is a **required** plugin. The plugin in will not work if you do not have it.
2. [CrateReloaded](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/free-crate-reloaded-mystery-crate-1-8-1-14-x.861/) This is not required, but it's nice to have if you want to use the [Crate](https://github.com/c10coding/BlockBR-2.0/wiki/Crates) rewards
3. [PlugMan](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/plugman) This is not required, but it's nice to have because it allows you to easily load and reload your plugins without having to restart the server entirely.

# How to use the plugin
